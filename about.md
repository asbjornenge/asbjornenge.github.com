# About

My name is Asbj√∏rn Enge. I'm a software enthusiast living in [Sandnes, Norway](http://maps.google.no/maps/place?ftid=0x463a36437b9b9cf5:0xe6ef5562b66909e0&q=sandnes&hl=no&ved=0CAwQ-gswAA&sa=X&ei=9ooXUbWwBsff8QOKrIDAAg).

I'm really passionate about [free software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software) and the [web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web). I do engineering & design of web clients, APIs and server side services. I also do cloud architecture and devops. I care about modular design, simplicity and readability. I do not care for huge frameworks and confusing abstractions. My preferred languages are [python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language\)) & [javascript](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript).

I sometimes do consulting, talks and courses. Get in [touch](https://twitter.com/asbjornenge).

When I'm not hacking code I dabble in the water of words and melody. I write and perform songs. I play the guitar, harmonica and some percussion. You can find some of my music on [itunes](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/asbjorn-enge/id528981222).

I'm also an amateur coffee fanatic. My preferred brewing method is pourover by [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com). I prefer washed, light and floral african beans. I get my coffee from a number of places including [Coffeeberry](http://www.coffeeberry.no), [Tim Wendelboe](http://timwendelboe.no), [Kaffa](http://www.kaffa.no) and [Square Mile Coffee](http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com).
