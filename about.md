> We're alive once, let's make a fucking nice cake!

I'm an amateur coffee fanatic. My preferred brewing method is pourover by [Chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com). I prefer light and floral african beans, washed. I get my coffee from a number of places including [Coffeeberry](http://www.coffeeberry.no), [Tim Wendelboe](http://timwendelboe.no), [Kaffa](http://www.kaffa.no) and [Square Mile Coffee](http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com).
