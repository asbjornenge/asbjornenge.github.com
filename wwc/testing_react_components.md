# Testing React

Lately I've been doing client side architecture for our front end development team at work. [Reactjs](http://facebook.github.io/react/) (a Javascript library for building user interfaces) is a big part of our new strategy. I really enjoy how it abstracts the DOM ...

It also really lends itself to TDD and testing in general. With small, focused components relying mostly on props (parameters) it requires little mock.

Like any sane Javascript developer I use mocha. It has the nyancat reporter. Nuff said.
