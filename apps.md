[https://clubhut.co](https://clubhut.co) is a resource allocator for Clubs and Companies. It was originally designed as a booking system for companies that have cabins shared between employees (a normal thing in Norway). But it can be used for fair allocation of any type of shared resource. ClubHut is [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) and you can sign up for a 30 day free trail [here](https://clubhut.co/#/register).
