> A tiny RESTful API microframework

Centipede is a [WSGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) microframework. It aims to facilitate quick creation of RESTful API's using python. By design centipede tries to express the http protocol, rather than hiding it behind confusing abstractions. Centipede digs decorators.
