> A tiny RESTful API microframework

Centipede is a [WSGI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Server_Gateway_Interface) microframework. It aims to facilitate quick creation of RESTful API's using python. By design centipede tries to express the http protocol, rather than hiding it behind confusing abstractions. Centipede digs decorators.

> Tiny hairy templates

Stubble is my approach to javascript templates. It's a really tiny library both in size (552 B gzipped) and functionality. But it has a nice little declarative plugin system so you can grow it much any way you want.
